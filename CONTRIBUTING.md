# Welcome to the Portfolio Website contributing guide <!-- omit in toc (table of contents) -->

<!--

NOTE: (I THINK) The following 2 are WRT another task outside of this [repo](https://github.com/JamieBort/Portfolio-Website) and this [project](https://github.com/users/JamieBort/projects/1).

1. TODO: Test all of the links below to see which ones need to be modified/updated for when the template is used.

2. Then make note of them with `TODO: FOR THIS TEMPLATE: <instructions here>.`

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to this project!

Read our [Contributor Covenant Code Of Conduct](./Contributor_Covenant_Code_of_Conduct.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening a GitHub [Issue](#issues) to creating, reviewing, and finally merging the [Pull Request](#pull-request) (PR); as well as searching for an existing GitHub Issue.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](./README.md) file.

Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

<!-- TODO: Add this line back in once I have Issue Templates and/or Issue forms to use here.
To that end, I have created this https://github.com/users/JamieBort/projects/4?pane=issue&itemId=55135312 organizational-level Issue to complete that task. -->
<!-- If a related Issue doesn't exist, you can open a new Issue using a relevant [Issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). -->

#### Solve an existing Issue

Another option to contribute to is solve an existing GitHub Issue.

Scan through our [existing Issues](https://github.com/JamieBort/Portfolio-Website/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See "[Label reference](https://github.com/JamieBort/Portfolio-Website/labels)" for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign Issues to anyone. If you find a GitHub Issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix. (What are Labels? [More info here](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference).)

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in a codespace

For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "[Working in a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/setting-up-your-environment-to-work-on-github-docs/working-on-github-docs-in-a-codespace)."

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

- Using GitHub Desktop:

  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. [Create a working branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#editing-a-fork) and start with your changes!

3. Start to edit the code. Refer to the [Installation](./frontend/README.md/#installation) and [Deployment](./frontend/README.md/#-deployment) sections of the front end [README](./frontend/README.md) file. There is not currently a back end.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to use the "[Self review checklist](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/self-review-checklist)" to speed up the review process :zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, open a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge conflicts, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve them.

### Your PR is merged!
