Thoughts and notes about implementing a Spanish translation of my website using a single toggle button.

**Issues to address:**

1. have the default language displayed be based on the user's default settings

2. have a single button/switch to toggle between the two languages, not one button for each language.

> Translating your portfolio website into Spanish and providing a toggle button for users to switch between languages can be a good practice from both an accessibility and user experience standpoint.
> Here are some considerations to keep in mind:

> Accessibility:
> Screen Readers: Many screen readers can handle multiple languages, so having a translated version of your website can benefit users who are more comfortable reading in Spanish.

> SEO:
> If you want your website to be discoverable by Spanish-speaking employers, having a dedicated Spanish version can improve your website's SEO for relevant search terms.

> User Experience:
> User Preference: Some users may prefer to read content in their native language, so providing a toggle option can enhance their experience.
> Clarity: Machine translations like Google Translate can sometimes produce inaccurate translations, so having a professionally translated version by your friends is a good approach.

> Implementation:
> Ensure that the toggle button is easily accessible and that it's labeled clearly, such as "English" and "Español."
> Consider implementing proper HTML lang attributes to indicate the language of the page to assist search engines and assistive technologies.
> While it may involve some extra work to maintain two language versions, it's a considerate approach, especially if you're targeting Spanish-speaking employers. Just ensure that the translation is accurate and clear to avoid any confusion or accessibility issues.

> Hope this helps!

Also waiting to hear back from Nely and Rosalía about translations.
