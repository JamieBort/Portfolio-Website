`index2_v3.htm` is now exactly what I need for my website.

index1.html - copied without editing.
index2.html - Copy of `index1.html`. Stripped down.
index2_v2.html - Copy of `index2.html`. Stripped down further.
index2_v3.html - Copy of `index2_v2.html`. Stripped down further. This is what I need for the `breakpoint` branches. **For mobile and desktop.**
