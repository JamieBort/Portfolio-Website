# Revamp2023

## Status

* Done.
    >Modify the CSS so that the navigation menu overlays over the content of the website, no matter where the user is currently in the website. (at the moment, the user needs to scroll to the top of the website in order to see the navigation menu.)
    >If necessary, modify the CSS and/or JavaScript so that the navigation menu disappears after a button in the navigation menu is selected.

* Implemented the menu navigation. But the navigation menu is not overlaying over the content of the website properly. 
    >Implement the basic JavaScript functionality to display and hid an html element by toggling the button.

* With commit 20cf11710ea8067d5ce3c119e5265b726300f123 just created the basic framework for the website.

### Next Steps

* Use media queries to implement the navigation differently for laptop/desktop.

* Add this `Revamp2023.md` file to the `Revamp2023` branch.

    Then modify the `Status` and `Next Steps` sections of it.

* Close out this `basic_framework` branch.

* **The following is for other branches.**
    * Create a new branch for styling the website.
    * Clean up the `id` and `class` names.
    * Clean up the html tags - change any that are not appropriate for that part or purpose of the website.
    * Style the navigation menu that displays when the navigation button is selected.
    * Deliberately choose text sizes.
    * Deliberately choose units.
