# Welcome to the repo for my [Portfolio Website](https://jamiebort.com/)

### Here you will be able to

- read a bit about me,
- see a few projects that I am highlighting,
- and lastly find out how to contact me as well as follow me on social media.

### Notable Features

Notable features of this site are:

- It is written in vanilla JavaScript.
- I wrote web components for navigation.
- I am in the process of making this site accessible by following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
- It is fully responsive.

### Aspirations

This site

- will link to my blog,
- and have
  - a `Contact Me` form,
  - a `Resources` page
  - and a page of `Fun Things` to explore

Additionally, on each relevant page you will be able to filter the content by a text field or by selecting key phrases (css, debugging, back end, etc.) and attributes (title, date, etc.).

I will continue to make changes to this site to make it more accessible.

Lastly, I will continue to add content to the `Resources` and `Fun Things` pages as well as my blog.
