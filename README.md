# Welcome to the repo for my [Portfolio Website](https://jamiebort.github.io/)

## About

This is the repo to my static portfolio website hosted by GitHub.

However I am currently in the process of hosting the Vite + React frontend and Node Express back end using Render.com.

Among other new features I will take advantage of using an I18y library to translate parts of my site that are dynamically updated from GraphQL api calls.

I have already translated the static sections into Spanish.

## Notable Features

Notable features of this site are:

- It is written in vanilla JavaScript.
- I wrote web components for navigation.
- I am continually trying to make this (and all of my projects) more accessible by following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
- It is fully responsive.

## Aspirations

This site

- will link to my blog,
- and will have
  - a `Contact Me` form,
  - a `Resources` page (containing content relevant to all aspects of coding from writing bash scripts to writing accessible code to contributing to open source projects),
  - and a `Fun Things` page to explore containing random things that I found interesting.

Additionally, on each relevant page you will be able to filter the content by a text field or by selecting key phrases (css, debugging, back end, etc.) and attributes (title, date, etc.).

I will update each section periodically as I come across new or interesting material.

If you anything that needs a correction, please let me know! And create a pull request.
