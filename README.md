# Welcome to the repo for my [Portfolio Website](https://jamiebort.com/)

## About

The front end was built using React, TypeScript, and Vite by adapting a template to suit my needs. It continues to be hosted hosted on [Render](https://render.com/).

Taken verbatim via the template:

> A modern, responsive portfolio template built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Features smooth animations, optimized performance, and accessibility-first design.

### 🚀 Front end features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite 6
- **Styled with Emotion**: Utilizes `@emotion/styled` for component-based styling
- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by Framer Motion
- **Optimized Performance**:
  - Automatic code splitting
  - Brotli & Gzip compression
  - Lazy-loaded components
  - Bundle size visualization
- **Fully Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all devices
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Built-in theming support
- It is fully responsive.
- I18y library to translate
- more accessible by following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

More info about the front end can be found in the front end [README](./frontend/README.md) file.

<!-- ### 🚀 Back end features -->
<!-- TODO: Add back end features when I have a back end.  -->

## Aspirations

Future improvements include

- a Contact Me form,
- further accessibility (A11Y) improvements ensure compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG),
- include dynamic translation of the project descriptions,
- adding code testing,
- enabling the Dark Mode feature,
- and adding a back end to asynchronously pull in data to dynamically update the project cards by making GRAPH API calls.
