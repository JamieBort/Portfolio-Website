# Design Changes

List of things that need to change with the website.

## Throughout the site.

- CSS Transitions for

  - navigation menu

  - links

  - buttons

  Search for

      - `css transition property navigation`

      - and for `css transition property buttons`

      - and for `css transition property links`

### Head tag

- Change `<head><title>Jamie Bort</title></head>` so that nothing but my logo shows up in the browser tab, including `Jamie Bort` and `index.html`. Or leave it alone - I like Jamie bort there.

### Styling/CSS

- The buttons.

- The nav menu.

- The colors of

  - the links
  - footer/header

- The `Jamie Bort` button in the header doesn't bring the page to the top but instead to my `<h1>` tag.

### Connect with Me Section

- Swap the .png icons for the Font Awesome logos.
