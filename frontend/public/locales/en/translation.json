I create elegant solutions to complex problems; specializing in modern web development with a focus on accessibility and user experience. I write code and teach at <CustomComponent01>{{name01}}</CustomComponent01>, a software boot camp for underrepresented people. Below you will find some highlighted projects. Most of my repos are open to collaborators. Please consider contributing! As always, I am open to new work opportunities. When I am not working I am preparing for my next presentation, mentoring, or hosting monthly algorithmic problem solving sessions; all of which push me to learn and grow. The problem solving sessions are open to everyone. More info <CustomComponent04>{{name04}}</CustomComponent04> . <CustomComponent03>{{name03}}</CustomComponent03> with me on social media below."

It is built with an accessibility-first approach, following WCAG standards, the i18next translation library, and using a modern tech stack of React 19, TypeScript, and Vite 6. And it is fully responsive working seamlessly across all devices, includes smooth animations via Framer Motion, and optimized performance through code splitting, lazy loading, and compression. Future features include adding code testing, a contact form and a searchable and filterable blog and resource pages.",
