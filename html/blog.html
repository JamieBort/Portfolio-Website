            Spring Boot - It's been a minute since I last worked with it. So I
            am refreshing my memory by working on a side project with it.

            Statistics - In addition to having a genuine interest in it I also
            have projects that require me to know that branch of mathematics
            better.
          </li>

            Data visualization - It's a fun and challenging way to represent the
            data that I enjoy crunching.

            Presenting - I enjoy sharing and exchanging knowledge. But talking
            in front of large crowds scares me. In spite of that I know it will
            also make me a better communicator, coder, and coworker.
