                Please excuse the mess; particularly when viewing this website from a mobile device. I'm rebuilding it from scratch while I work on other projects. So this may take
                some time. The changes will be incremental.
              </p>
              <p>I use software to solve problems and create things. Through this website I hope to share a bit of my knowledge with others.</p>
              <p>
                I am a member and co-organizer of <a href="https://devsrtp.com/" target="_blank"><img id="devs_img" src="../assets/devsatrtp/DevsLogo.svg" /></a>.
                <img id="devs_img" src="../assets/devsatrtp/DevsLogo.svg" /> is a community of people in technology, primarily but not exclusively software developers. Many have
                made the switch to the tech field from unrelated careers. Others are recent computer science graduates. And a minority have been in the field for many years. We'll
                collaborate on projects, discuss the minutia of work life, and once in a while, we'll meet for a social event. Before the pandemic we hosted weekly coding nights;
                where we'd meet at a coffee shop to collaborate on projects.
              </p>
              <p>Some other things that have my attention at the moment:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Statistics - In addition to having a genuine interest in it I also have projects that require me to know that branch of mathematics better.</li>
                <li>Data visualization - It's a fun and challenging way to represent the data that I enjoy crunching.</li>
                <li>Presenting - Frankly the idea of it scares me. But I know it will help me become a better communicator, and by extension, a better coder and teammate.</li>
                <li>Mentors - I could use one. But I also enjoy mentoring others.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Right now this portfolio page consists of just a bio, projects, and contact information. Shortly (in the coming weeks?) I'll have:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>A form that you can reach me by.</li>
                <li>A resources page listing various resources I use for a range of needs. From plugins for my favorite IDE to where to go to get interview practice.</li>
                <li>
                  A blog where I'll share my journey as a coder discussing the mistakes I've made, the differences between a class and an interface, and how to scaffold an existing
                  database.
                </li>
                <li>And lastly, a page dedicated to a few of the things I find fun or interesting.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I hope you find this site to be a fun and valuable source for knowledge no matter where you are on your coding journey!</p>
