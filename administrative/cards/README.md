# Cards

Created this directory to keep all of my Card component research.

I have the option of building my own card for my Projects section.

Or using a library to use their card component.

I'll explore all options here.

## Options

### NextUI card components

Didn't get it working. Package issue.

Pluse, too many packages were installed.

https://nextui.org/docs/components/card

### CoreUI card components

Starting with this one.

Install the following for this library using `yarn add <package name>`:

```
"@coreui/coreui": "^4.3.2",
"@coreui/react": "^4.11.1",
```
