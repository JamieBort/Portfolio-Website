# ToDo Items

Items to be addressed in the `fullstack_cleanup` branch.

Or to be moved to the `./administrative/Tasks.md` file to be addressed at a later date.

- re-deploy the front end with the name ~~frontend_react_jamiebort.github.io~~ `frontend_jamiebort.github.io`

- re-deploy the back end with the name `backend_jamiebort.github.io`

- close unused browser windows.

- restore the frontend gitignore file.

- change "var" to "const" in the ./backend/app.js file.

- merge the `back_end_express` branch into the `fullstack` branch.

- either

  - replace the frontend directory with typescript and Svelt

  - or rebuild the site (move the front end files and directories into the frontend directory)

    and replace the frontend directory with typescript and Svelt **goal for a later date**

- find a library to translate my repo descriptions into Spanish.**goal for a later date**

- merge the `fullstack` branch into the `dev` branch. Then merge the `dev` branch into the `master` branch.

- redirect jamiebort.com to https://jamiebort-github-io-frontend-react.onrender.com/

- remove the webservices associated with

  - https://express-hello-world-9pqq.onrender.com,

  - https://jamiebort-github-io-backend.onrender.com,

  - and https://jamiebort-github-io-frontend-react.onrender.com **IF the replacement is working correctly.**

- Research whether Render.com needs `./frontend/.gitignore` and `./backend/.gitignore` files. Or if I can use just `./.gitignore`.

- Research whether I can install cores with yarn alone, rather than have a package-lock.json file.

- Remove all the old branches. Including the `back_end` branches and the `front_end` branches and the `._backup` branches. But there be more.

- Delete the "JamieBort/express-hello-world" repo.

- Clean up the ./fontend/App.jsx file.

- Delete the ./fontend/.env.local file.
