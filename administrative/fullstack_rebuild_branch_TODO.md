# ToDo Items

Items to be addressed in the `fullstack_rebuild` branch.

Or to be moved to the `./administrative/Tasks.md` file to be addressed at a later date.

Today added navigation:
https://reactrouter.com/en/main/router-components/browser-router
and
https://reactrouter.com/en/main/router-components/hash-router

And added components mui components such as:
import { Box, Container, Grid, Stack, Typography, Icon, Link } from "@mui/material";

Today I styled the cards more.
I switched out the cards more.
I cleaned up the files.
I have created a standbyData variable for when the backend server is not available. This will be called in the event that the backend does not work.

- Do these 5 things together and in sequence:

  - merge the `fullstack` branch into the `dev` branch.

  - redeploy the frontend AND the backend. from the `dev` branch.

  - Then merge the `dev` branch into the `master` branch.

  - redeploy the frontend AND the backend. from the `master` branch.

  - Point the new frontend url to jamiebort.com
