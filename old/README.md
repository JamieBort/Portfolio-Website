# old/

This directory is for housing old files.

There are currently two directories

I don't recall what is inside of `temp/`.

Therefore I've created this directory to consolidate them.

### Directories and Files

#### Directories

- pre-Revamp2023/ - the entire project/directory from before 2023.

- pre-Revamp2023/ - This directory was created when I created the `Revamp2023` branch. It contains the contents of the `jamiebort.github.io` directory at the point of when the `Revamp2023` branch was created.

- temp/ - I think files and directories from after 202301. And definitely before 20230324.

#### Files

- README.md - this file.

- old_styles.css - styles from before 2023.

- old_styes.css - The previous stylesheet. `./html/old_index.html` links to it. Renamed because I rebuilt the index file and I wasn't ready to delete the old one yet.
