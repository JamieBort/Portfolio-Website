# Welcome to the repo for my [Portfolio Website](https://jamiebort.github.io/)

### Notable Features
Notable features of this site (that I have created/written) using 
* vanilla JavaScript:
* and using these libraries:
* contact me form
* web components

### Aspirations
This site will have a blog, a resources page, and a fun stuff page. All of which will have content that can be filtered.
By a text field and by drop-down menus. One for title. One for date. One for keep subjects (css, debugging, back end, etc.)

This README file will serve as the documentation for future employers. It will be linked to from my portfolio website.

I'll fill this out more as the website progresses.

### Business Requirements
The site shall:

* share information about me.
	* on the website itself
		* display my involvement with Devs@rtp and other similar organizations,
		* provide the user with a way to easily find, look at, and download my resume
		* display to the user all of the projects that I wish them to see.
		* show my interests as they pertain to my career and technical abilities.
		* show off my skills to the user without them having to navigate to my projects.
		* display in a graph, chart, or other visual representation my level of skills for each technology.
		
	* via links to other sites that I use such as
		* social media and
		* github

* have way(s) to contact me
	* bare minimum by email
		
### Functional Requirements

* allow the user to send me a message via a form that goes into my email inbox, (and maybe texts me?)
* follow accessibility standards.
* be responsive (works on screens of varying sizes.)
