                        <p>Please excuse the mess; particularly when viewing this website from a mobile device. I'm rebuilding it from scratch while I work on other projects. So this may take some time. The changes will be incremental.</p>
                        <p>I use software to solve problems and create things. Through this website I hope to share a
                            bit of my knowledge with others.</p>
                        <p>I am a member and co-organizer of <a href="https://devsrtp.com/" target="_blank"><img
                                    id="devs_img" src="../assets/devsatrtp/DevsLogo.svg"></a>. <img id="devs_img"
                                src="../assets/devsatrtp/DevsLogo.svg"> is a community of people in technology,
                            primarily but not exclusively software developers. Many have made the switch to the tech
                            field from unrelated careers. Others are recent computer science graduates. And a minority
                            have been in the field for many years. We'll collaborate on projects, discuss the minutia of
                            work life, and once in a while, we'll meet for a social event. Before the pandemic we hosted
                            weekly coding nights; where we'd meet at a coffee shop to collaborate on projects.</p>
                        <p>Some other things that have my attention at the moment:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Statistics - In addition to having a genuine interest in it I also have projects that
                                require me to know that branch of mathematics better.</li>
                            <li>Data visualization - It's a fun and challenging way to represent the data that I enjoy
                                crunching.</li>
                            <li>Presenting - Frankly the idea of it scares me. But I know it will help me become a
                                better
                                communicator, and by extension, a better coder and teammate.</li>
                            <li>Mentors - I could use one. But I also enjoy mentoring others.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Right now this portfolio page consists of just a bio, projects, and contact information.
                            Shortly
                            (in the coming weeks?) I'll have:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A form that you can reach me by.</li>
                            <li>A resources page listing various resources I use for a range of needs. From plugins for
                                my
                                favorite IDE to where to go to get interview practice.</li>
                            <li>A blog where I'll share my journey as a coder discussing the mistakes I've made, the
                                differences between a class and an interface, and how to scaffold an existing database.
                            </li>
                            <li>And lastly, a page dedicated to a few of the things I find fun or interesting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I hope you find this site to be a fun and valuable source for knowledge no matter where you
                            are on your coding journey!</p>
